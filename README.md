# Pony playground

Most of the code comes from [the Pony tutorial](https://tutorial.ponylang.org)

Some of it comes from [this blog post](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2015/11/04/a-quick-look-at-pony.html)

And some more of it comes from [this presentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/darach/my_little_pony/master/my-little-pony.html#/)
